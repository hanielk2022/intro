    <h1>Help stop porch pirates !!</h1>

    <p>Packages thieves, better known as porch pirates, are currently on the rise. According to a study, 36% of Americans have experienced package theft and 56% have had it happen to someone they know. 
        Unlike other types of thieves, porch pirates are unlikely to be deterred by front door cameras and are even known to visit the same house multiple times. Porch pirates are most likely to strike during the day when families are out at work and school. Although porch piracy occurs in large cities such as San Francisco and Seattle, rural areas are also greatly affected.

    <p>Not only does porch piracy result in lost goods, but it can cause feelings of fear and unsafety to victims. So what can we do to reduce porch piracy in our neighborhoods?</p>

    <p>Some ways that we can prevent package theft are installing security cameras, coordinating with neighbors, and closely tracking your deliveries. While these are valid prevention strategies, many people already do these things and have not seen a change in the amount of package thefts in their area. What else can we possibly do?</p>

    <p>It's time to get a little creative...</p>

    <p>You might have seen those funny tiktok videos of package thieves being caught redhanded, but what if you could spring a trap inside your package and catch the thieve without even having to leave your house?</p> 

    <p>Introduce... the glitter bomb !!</p>
